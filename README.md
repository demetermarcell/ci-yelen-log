## Mission Statement:
Yelen Log is a timesheet management application I developed to track my working hours for freelance projects.
The name "Yelen" is inspired by the Hungarian word jelen, meaning "now" or "present," reflecting a focus on the current moment. "Log" refers to recording or capturing data â€” together, Yelen Log represents the act of logging time as it happens.

## Product Backlog:
- The project was created based on the [YelenLog project board](https://github.com/users/demetermarcell/projects/6).

## Data Model:
